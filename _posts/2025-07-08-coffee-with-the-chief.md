On July 11, 2025, from 7 AM to 10 AM, Java Square will proudly host Coffee With The Chief, a special installment of OPD Community Conversations featuring the Opelousas Police Department. This casual morning gathering is an open invitation for our community to meet and engage with our cityâ€™s police chief and officersâ€”face to face, cup to cup.

At its heart, this event is about more than just coffee. Itâ€™s about connection. Itâ€™s a chance to ask questions, share concerns, express appreciation, and better understand the people behind the badge. When our community members and law enforcement sit down together, walls break down and trust begins to grow.

In a time when transparency and collaboration matter more than ever, we believe events like this help bridge the gap between those who serve and those they serve. Whether you're a lifelong Opelousas resident or new to the neighborhood, your voice mattersâ€”and we believe conversations over coffee are a powerful way to build the kind of city we all want to live in.

So join us on July 11. Bring your questions, your ideas, your storiesâ€”and letâ€™s continue the work of growing together as one community.
