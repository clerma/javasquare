The Opelousas Downtown Downtown Market has set forth to create a space and experience where visitors of all ages can see, taste, smell &amp; hear the best of what the area has to offer, in one location. </p>

    We are a curated market, which means you need to apply to have a spot. This is only to prevent the market from being set up like a flea market. To participate in the Opelousas  Downtown Market, vendors with services must be locally owned. Applications are reviewed. Responses are sent out within a couple of days of the submitted application.  Please request access to our Facebook group page. Upon acceptance, your access to the group will be approved.   If you do not plan on being a part of the month you are applying in. Please put that in the notes.
