- question: What is the morning set up procedure and how do I know where to set up?
  answer: "<li>Booth set up can take place anytime between 6:00 & 7:00. Please be setup ready to go by 7:30.</li>
	<li>I will send out a link with a labeled market map Friday evening before the market.</li>
	<li>Your designated booth space may change from week to week so please make sure to refer to the map each week. If you have committed to selling year round, you may receive a static booth space in the new year.</li>
	<li>When you arrive, you can unload either along 190 or Court St (depending on your designated booth space). Once you have quickly unloaded, we ask that you move your vehicle to one of the parking spaces around the court house or on the court street side.</li>"
- question: Is the Market only available for Vendors in Opelousas?
  answer: "<li>While we want this to highlight vendors from St. Landry, we don't want to deprive Opelousas shoppers access to great vendors from all over the area. So you do not have to be based in Opelousas. </li>"
- question: Do I have to sell a product?
  answer: "<li>Products are our main focus, but we are open to allow service businesses to highlight what they have to offer. We suggest if you are offering a service, that you make your booth engaging and visibly appealing. This prevents the market from looking like a job fair.</li>"
- question: Is this Market year round? Why do I only see 1 date?
  answer: "<li>Yes, the Market will run year round.  We only put this first date to gage the interest but will post more dates. </li>
	<li>We will probably take off a few weekends a year around Christmas and New Years.</li>
	<li>There is always the possibility of rain which could cancel some weekends.</li>"
- question: How do I keep my tent from blowing away?
  answer: "<li>You must provide at least 40 lbs of weight on each leg of your tent.</li>
	<li>It is very important to get a strong sturdy tent. You do not want to put other vendors at risk if you buy a flimsy tent that breaks and blows into your neighbor when the wind gusts.</li>"
- question: Why do I need a straight legged white tent?
  answer: "<li>Straight tent legs are required for equal positioning of the booths.</li>
	<li>Having all white tents presents a professional & uniformed appearance.</li>
	<li>We are all required to maintain an attractive and neat booth space while open. All boxes should be hidden under tables by start time.</li>"
- question: Do I really need to buy an NFPA 701 canopy? Is there anywhere in town that sells them?
  answer: "<li>Yes, fire marshals require all tents be properly permitted at outdoor markets now. The physical tag sewn into your canopy must say NFPA 701 Fire Resistant.</li>"
- question: Can I rent a tent from you?
  answer: "<li>We do not offer that at the moment, but might be able to offer that in the future for a small rental fee. </li>"
- question: Is there power?
  answer: '<li>There is little access of power outlets available, and those are reserved for food vendors, unless they do not need them. It could change each month. Food vendors may reserve power, but must supply a 50 foot outdoor rated extension cord and select that option in the application or in an email titled "NEED POWER".</li>'
- question: Can I smoke?
  answer: "<li>There is no smoking anywhere within the market. Anyone who needs to smoke may do so across the street on the sidewalk.</li>"
- question: Are there any items I can't sell?
  answer: '<li>This is a family friendly market. We request that we do not have anything that is "overtly offensive". Examples: T-shirts with large curse words printed, any religious icons, Satanic iconography, drug paraphernalia, sexually explicit products etcâ€¦</li>'
- question: Where is the little Girl's / Boy's room?
  answer: "<li>The coffee shop Java Square, next to the market, has good coffee, snacks, a clean bathroom and complementary cold water.</li>"
- question: Would it be possible for me to leave early?
  answer: "<li>We do not allow vendors to shut down before endtime unless previously agreed to by Management. </li>
	<li>If you have a previous engagement that will cause you to leave before close, please do not sign up to vend that day. If you have already signed up for the market, send an email explaining the situation and  decisions will be made case by case.</li>"
- question: Are we required to have a Sales Tax ID? How do I get one? Does it take long?
  answer: "<li>No, you are not required to have a Louisiana Sales Tax ID. However, we strongly encourage it and you are responsible to have any necessary items to operate.</li>
	  <li>You may file for a sales tax ID (<a href='https://geauxbiz.sos.la.gov/' target='_blank'>here</a>).</li>
		<li>Tax IDs do not take long to file for or to process. </li>"

- question: General Liability Insurance
  answer: "<li>Liability claims can be very expensive for an event director even when they have insurance that covers the entire event. Claims arising out of artist or vendor negligence can cause insurance premiums to increase and/or risk policy non-renewal.</li>
  <li>You can purchase a policy ( <a href='https://www.actinsurance.com/policy/buy/ai/OTU2' taget='_blank'>here</a>).</li>"
